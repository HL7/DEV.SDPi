# IHE DEV TF SDPi Supplement

This Github project advances the *IHE DEV TF SDPi Supplement*, including all artifacts that are included in the development of the draft supplement documents. The primary focus of the IHE DEV SDPi profiles are device-to-device plug-n-trust interoperability around high-acuity point-of-care contexts (e.g., operating room, ICU, emergency room bed, etc.). These SDPi profiles leverage the ISO/IEEE 11073 Service-oriented Device Connectivity (SDC) standards.
