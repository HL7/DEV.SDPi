[#vol2_clause_appendix_a_mdib_report_retrofit]
==== MDIB Report Retrofit

In addition to <<vol3_clause_mdib_report_retrofit>>, this section specifies requirements to an MDPWS transport binding. The requirements aim to verify that <<acronym_mdib>> versions received by a <<vol1_spec_sdpi_p_actor_somds_consumer>> are not decremented and present no gap.

.R1001
[sdpi_requirement#r1001,sdpi_req_level=shall]
****
A <<vol1_spec_sdpi_p_actor_somds_provider>> shall only establish one TCP connection at a time for every subscribed <<vol1_spec_sdpi_p_actor_somds_consumer>>.
****

.R1002
[sdpi_requirement#r1002,sdpi_req_level=shall]
****
A <<vol1_spec_sdpi_p_actor_somds_participant>> shall utilize TCP to exchange messages with other <<vol1_spec_sdpi_p_actor_somds_participant>>s except for messages exchanged in the WS-Discovery Ad-hoc mode.

.Notes
[%collapsible]
====
NOTE: The WS-Discovery Ad-hoc mode utilizes UDP to exchange messages, see <<ref_oasis_ws_discovery_2009>>.
====
****

.R1003
[sdpi_requirement#r1003,sdpi_req_level=shall]
****
A <<vol1_spec_sdpi_p_actor_somds_participant>> shall only utilize HTTP 1.1 without HTTP pipelining for any HTTP traffic.

.Notes
[%collapsible]
====
NOTE: Enforces use of HTTP 1.1 in order to limit choices by which a re-ordering of message delivery can be implemented.
====
****

.R1004
[sdpi_requirement#r1004,sdpi_req_level=shall]
****
A <<vol1_spec_sdpi_p_actor_somds_provider>> shall transmit msg:WaveformStream, msg:AbstractMetricReport, msg:AbstractOperationalStateReport, msg:AbstractComponentReport, msg:AbstractAlertReport, msg:ObservedValueStream, msg:DescriptionModificationReport, and msg:AbstractContextReport messages sequentially.

.Notes
[%collapsible]
====
NOTE: This allows for a <<vol1_spec_sdpi_p_actor_somds_consumer>> to apply report data on internal <<acronym_mdib>> data structures before receiving the next report without buffering.
====
****



// ==================================================
// Supporting detection of lost reports by consumers.
//


.R1005
[sdpi_requirement#r1005,sdpi_req_level=should]
****
A <<vol1_spec_sdpi_p_actor_somds_consumer>> should reconnect or go into a fail-safe mode when it receives a report with an <<acronym_mdib>> version that is either lower than the last received version or more than one version higher than the last received version.
****

.R1006
[sdpi_requirement#r1006,sdpi_req_level=shall]
****
A <<vol1_spec_sdpi_p_actor_somds_provider>> shall include an `sdpi:ReportSequence` element in every report header.

.Notes
[%collapsible]
====
NOTE: The `sdpi:ReportSequence` element enables detection of lost reports by a <<vol1_spec_sdpi_p_actor_somds_consumer>>.
====
****

.R1007
[sdpi_requirement#r1007,sdpi_req_level=should]
****
A <<vol1_spec_sdpi_p_actor_somds_consumer>> should reconnect or go into a fail-safe mode when it receives a report in a single publish-subscribe session with a `sdpi:ReportSequence/@MessageNumber` that is either:

* not 1 for the first message received in a new session, or
* lower than the last `sdpi:ReportSequence/@MessageNumber` number received in an on-going session, or
* more than 1 greater than the last `sdpi:ReportSequence/@MessageNumber` number received in an on-going session.

.Notes
[%collapsible]
====
* A publish-subscribe session is established between a <<vol1_spec_sdpi_p_actor_somds_provider>> and <<vol1_spec_sdpi_p_actor_somds_consumer>> using Transaction [DEV-27] (<<vol2_clause_dev_27>>). 
* Renewing an established publish-subscribe session does not establish a new session and does not cause `sdpi:ReportSequence/@MessageNumber` to restart from 1.
====
****

.R100x
[sdpi_requirement#r100x,sdpi_req_level=shall]
****
A <<vol1_spec_sdpi_p_actor_somds_consumer>> shall treat subsequent reports with the same `sdpi:ReportSequence/@MessageNumber` as functionally identical following confirmation of successful delivery. 

.Notes
[%collapsible]
====
* A <<vol1_spec_sdpi_p_actor_somds_consumer>> may receive multiple reports with the same `sdpi:ReportSequence/@MessageNumber` when the <<vol1_spec_sdpi_p_actor_somds_provider>> does not receive confirmation of successful delivery from the <<vol1_spec_sdpi_p_actor_somds_consumer>>. 
* A <<vol1_spec_sdpi_p_actor_somds_consumer>> is not required to process the content of multiple reports with the same `sdpi:ReportSequence/@MessageNumber`.
* A <<vol1_spec_sdpi_p_actor_somds_provider>> will not increment the `sdpi:ReportSequence/@MessageNumber` until it receives confirmation of successful delivery from the <<vol1_spec_sdpi_p_actor_somds_consumer>>. 
* A <<vol1_spec_sdpi_p_actor_somds_provider>> that receives a fault response from a <<vol1_spec_sdpi_p_actor_somds_consumer>> may change or delay the message to address the fault. 
====
****


.R100x
[sdpi_requirement#r100x,sdpi_req_level=shall]
****
A <<vol1_spec_sdpi_p_actor_somds_consumer>> that receives multiple reports with the same `sdpi:ReportSequence/@MessageNumber` shall either:

* acknowledge receipt with an HTTP response code, or
* terminate the publish-subscribe session using the mechanisms described in Transaction [DEV-27] (<<vol2_clause_dev_27>>).

.Notes
[%collapsible]
====
* A <<vol1_spec_sdpi_p_actor_somds_provider>> may send multiple reports with the same `sdpi:ReportSequence/@MessageNumber` when it receives a fault code from the <<vol1_spec_sdpi_p_actor_somds_consumer>> (e.g., the consumer is busy processing other messages) or no response (time-out following a network interruption).
* A <<vol1_spec_sdpi_p_actor_somds_consumer>> may receive multiple reports with the same `sdpi:ReportSequence/@MessageNumber` when it responds with a fault code

.R1014
[sdpi_requirement#r1014,sdpi_req_level=shall]
****
A <<actor_somds_provider>> shall not send a notification of a subscription as long as there is another notification pending for that subscription.

NOTE: This also requires <<actor_somds_provider>>s to serialize delivery of msg:OperationInvokedReport messages.
