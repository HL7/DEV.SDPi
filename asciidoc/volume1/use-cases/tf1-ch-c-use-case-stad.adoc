=== Use Case Feature {var_use_case_id}: <<label_use_case_name_stad>> (<<acronym_stad>>)

// NOTE:  See use case labels in document-declarations.adoc

==== Narrative
Nurse Jean attaches a ventilator to the medical device network in the ICU.  It automatically obtains the correct time.

==== Benefits
Automatically acquiring the time saves the user from spending time entering the time into the device.  It also guarantees that the correct time will be entered.
It is also important for all devices to have a consistent time since the data being exported to consuming devices and systems will use the time stamps from the device to mark the time that the clinical data was acquired.  Since this is part of the clinical record, accuracy is very important.

==== Technical Pre-Conditions

*Given* All devices communicate using a common <<acronym_md_lan>> protocol

*And* A Time Source (TS) Service is on the <<acronym_md_lan>> network

[#vol1_clause_appendix_c_use_case_stad_scenarios]
==== Scenarios

===== Scenario: <<acronym_stad>> {var_use_case_id}.1 - Device is connected to the MD LAN network with a Time Source service

*Given* Device has detected at least one <<acronym_ts_service>>

*When* The <<acronym_ts_service>> is operational

*Then* The device will synchronize its time with the <<acronym_ts_service>>

****
The <<term_manufacturer>> of a <<vol1_spec_sdpi_p_actor_somds_participant>> shall include all of the following information in the accompanying documentation:

 * The responsible organization needs to provide a <<acronym_ts_service>> with 50 millisecond accuracy.
 * The responsible organization needs to provide a redundant <<acronym_ts_service>> configuration with at least one backup server.

****
The <<term_manufacturer>> of a <<vol1_spec_sdpi_p_actor_somds_participant>> should configure its <<acronym_ts_service>> client to give priority to system clock adjustments that are slewing (over stepping adjustments).

.Notes

===== Scenario: <<acronym_stad>> {var_use_case_id}.2 - Device is connected to the MD LAN network and a user wants to change the device's time

*Given* Device is operational in <<acronym_md_lan>> network

*When*  The user attempts to change the time on the device manually

*Then* The device will disable the ability to change its time manually

****
A <<vol1_spec_sdpi_p_actor_somds_participant>> shall not allow manual configuration of its internal clock while the device is operational in an <<acronym_md_lan>> network.

.Notes
[%collapsible]
====
NOTE: Since manual time adjustments of the device's internal clock would lead to plausible but still inaccurate timestamps, this requirement also prohibits manual adjustments when the <<acronym_ts_service>> is not available.

===== Scenario: <<acronym_stad>> {var_use_case_id}.3 - Device is connected to the MD LAN network and cannot connect to a TS Service

*Given* Device has just connected to the <<acronym_md_lan>> network and has not detected any <<acronym_ts_service>>s

*When* The <<acronym_ts_service>> is not operational or inaccessible

*Then* The device will not participate on the <<acronym_md_lan>> network until it detects and connects to a <<acronym_ts_service>>

===== Scenario: <<acronym_stad>> {var_use_case_id}.4 - Devices are operational in the MD LAN network but cannot access the TS Service

*Given* Device is operational on the <<acronym_md_lan>> network

*When* The <<acronym_ts_service>> is no longer operational or otherwise inaccessible

*Then* The device will rely on its internal clock for time synchronization

*And* The device will provide the accuracy of its clock in its <<acronym_mdib>>

*And* The device will periodically attempt to reconnect to the <<acronym_ts_service>>

*And* The device will notify the user about the fact, that the <<acronym_ts_service>> cannot be reached

*And* The device will create a log entry noting the disconnection from the <<acronym_ts_service>>

*And* The ability to change the device time manually will remain disabled

NOTE: Device internal clocks are usually accurate enough to bridge short periods of time when no time-servers are accessible. Manual time synchronization is considered too inaccurate for SDC System Functionality.

NOTE: By using the device's clock accuracy, a consumer can decide if received data is accurate enough for its use case. This may cause the consumer to disconnect from the device.

NOTE: A <<term_manufacturer>> may decide to limit user notification of technical issues to certain user groups (e.g., biomed).

*REVIEWER QUESTION*:Do we need a requirement stating this explicitly, or is BPKP TR0916 sufficient, since a <<acronym_ts_service>> not being available can be considered as a change in the <<acronym_ts_service>>.

===== Scenario: <<acronym_stad>> {var_use_case_id}.5 - Devices are operational in the MD LAN network but cannot access the TS Service and clock drift is unacceptable

*Given* The <<vol1_spec_sdpi_p_actor_somds_consumer>> is operational on the <<acronym_md_lan>> network

*And* The <<acronym_ts_service>> is no longer operational or otherwise inaccessible

*When* The clock drift of the device internal clock exceeds an internal threshold

*Or* The timestamps of the received data are no longer accurate enough

*Then* The device will notify the user that time synchronization is no longer functional, which will limit the availability of SDC System Functionality

*And* The device will create a log entry noting inaccurate time synchronization

*And* The device will periodically attempt to reconnect to the <<acronym_md_lan>> and <<acronym_ts_service>>

*And* Based on a <<term_manufacturer>>'s risk management, the device may be disconnected entirely from the <<acronym_md_lan>> network.

[#vol1_clause_appendix_c_use_case_stad_non_slew]
===== Scenario: <<acronym_stad>> {var_use_case_id}.6 - A device, operational in the MD LAN network, determines a non-slewing time adjustment is required

*Given* The device is operational on the <<acronym_md_lan>> network,

*When* The device's clock-discipline algorithm determines a non-slewing time adjustment is required,

*Then* The device will create a log entry that includes at least a time-stamp for the adjustment in both the time-reference frame before and after the non-slewing adjustment was made,

*And* The <<vol1_spec_sdpi_p_actor_somds_provider>> will notify <<vol1_spec_sdpi_p_actor_somds_consumer>>s using its system function contributions (<<acronym_sfc>>) of the change to the provider's time-reference frame,  

*Or* The <<vol1_spec_sdpi_p_actor_somds_provider>> will initiate a new MDIB sequence.

NOTE: a device's time-reference frame may jump forward or backward in time in a single, large, step, from the perspective of an external observer, following a non-slewing time adjustment. 

NOTE: two distinct epochs are created by a non-slewing time adjustment, each with a distinct time-reference frame. Both the rate of the passage of time and the determination time assigned to a single event may differ significantly between epochs. 

NOTE: non-slewing time adjustments may occur, for example, when a device rejoins a network, an absent <<acronym_ts_service>> returns to operation or be caused by hardware failure or operator error (e.g., making non-slewing adjustments to the <<acronym_ts_service>> time-reference frame while it is being used by one or more <<vol1_spec_sdpi_p_actor_somds_participant>>s). 

NOTE: non-slewing time adjustments may result in a constant or variable offset between epochs. For constant offsets, the difference (to an unbiased observer) between any two timestamps obtained in different epochs is constant. For variable offsets, the difference (to an unbiased observer) between any two timestamps obtained in different epochs depends on when, within each epoch, the timestamp was obtained.

****

// This is for providers to inform consumers of the non-slewing adjustment.
// It is necessary to have a version here for providers that don't use NTP clock-discipline to smoothly adjust clocks and just set the clock (hopefully not going back in time).
// Using `ClockState/@LastSet` like this avoids having to extend everything that needs a timestamp to support versioning (because any timestamp in the MDIB before the LastSet
// is questionable following a transition to a new epoch). Epoch versioning is then an extension that lets the consumer determine how questionable a timestamp is. 
// If we have a `Epochs/@Current` and update `ClockState/@LastSet` I don't think we need to also include a "Questionable" flag or change `ClockState/@ActiviationState` as proposed
// during the workshop. Using `ClockState/@LastSet` seems better than just changing the @Activation state because the consumer could determine which timestamps are questionable.

****
When the <<vol1_spec_sdpi_p_actor_somds_provider>> detects a step adjustment of its system clock used as part of its System Function Contribution (<<acronym_sfc>>), the <<vol1_spec_sdpi_p_actor_somds_provider>> shall either:

* initiate a new MDIB sequence by assigning a new MDIB sequence identifier, or
* set `pm:ClockState/@LastSet` to the earliest time that is unambiguously in the current epoch and increment `sdpi:Epochs/@Current`.

.Notes
[%collapsible]
====
NOTE: The <<term_manufacturer>> of the <<vol1_spec_sdpi_p_actor_somds_consumer>> considers the risks arising from timestamps spanning time-reference frames from a non-slewing clock adjustment having occurred at the <<vol1_spec_sdpi_p_actor_somds_provider>> when the <<vol1_spec_sdpi_p_actor_somds_consumer>> receives a changed value in the <<vol1_spec_sdpi_p_actor_somds_provider>>'s MDIB sequence identifier or `pm:ClockState/@LastSet` and `sdpi:Epochs/@Current`.

NOTE: This clarifies the ambiguity in <<ref_ieee_11073_10207_2017>>, section B.182 when slewing is used to smoothly adjust the time-reference frame (using, for example, the <<ref_rfc_5905, NTPv4>> clock-discipline algorithm) where information from one or more <<acronym_ts_service>>s is used to maintain clock-discipline and does not "set" the clock.

NOTE: Any timestamps in the MDIB prior to `pm:ClockState/@LastSet` may not have been obtained from the current time-reference.

====
****

Any time-stamps obtained in an ealier epoch may be treated with greater suspicion than those obtained in the current epoch by a <<vol1_spec_sdpi_p_actor_somds_participant>>. `pm:ClockState/@LastSet` provides the unambiguous begining of the current epoch in the time-frame reference of the current epoch. For example, when a non-slewing adjustment moves the device's time-frame reference forward, any timestamps in the MDIB greater than start of the new epoch are unambiguously in the new epoch. In contrast, when the device's time-frame reference moves backward, only timestamps greater than the latest timestamp obtained from the epoch before the time-reference frame moved backward are unambiguously in the current epoch. That is, the timestamps obtained from the new time-frame reference may overlap timestamps obtained from the prior time-frame reference. These examples are illustrated below:

There is no overlap in timestamps when a non-slewing adjustment shifts the device clock forward in time. 

image::vol1-diagram-use-case-stad-ns-forward.svg[align=center]

When a non-slewing adjustment shifts the device's time-frame reference back in time, only timestamps before the last timestamp recorded in the MDIB from epoch 0 belong unambiguously to the new time-frame reference.

image::vol1-diagram-use-case-stad-ns-back.svg[align=center]

When a device experiences multiple non-slewing adjustments in a short period of time, the earliest timestamp unambiguously in the current time-frame reference may be from an earlier epoch.

.Notes
[NOTE]
[%collapsible]
====
It may not be possible to reliably determine the relationship between timestamps obtained from different time-frame references without addition information regarding the cause of the non-slewing adjustment. For example, if a non-slewing adjustment arises because the device clock was running faster (or slower) than the reference clock then the arithmetic difference between two events spanning the adjustment (even when combined with the step adjustment duration) may not match the actual different in time measured by an unbiased observer.
